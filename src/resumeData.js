    "aboutme1": "Hi! My name is Nehemias (pronounced “ni-uh-my-us” ). I am a Class of 2021 MBA graduate from Harvard Business School. I am leveraging my MBA and career experiences to catapult my career into Product or Program Management in Seattle, Washington.",
    "aboutme2": "What you’ll quickly learn about me is that I have an insatiable love for taking on new challenges and partnering with others. As a result, I’ve been lucky enough to spend the early years of my career within distinct industries (semiconductors, cloud computing, and education) and functions (supply chain, corporate finance, program management, and investment strategy). The breadth of my experience has given me the opportunity to become a jack of all trades. I tackle tough business problems by drawing on these experiences to arrive at solutions that are mindful of the impact on a firm from multiple perspectives. ",
    "aboutme3": "A common thread in my career, however, has been that in each role I’ve needed to work cross-functionally with multiple teams in order to drive meaningful results. I actively rely on my core strengths of driving towards consensus and leading with empathy to earn the trust of my peers and move my teams in ways that drive positive outcomes. ",
    "aboutme4": "In addition to earning my MBA, I continually seek to improve my product building skills. I’ve used several business ideas to improve upon my product management skill set. Thus far, I’ve learned fundamental front end code, conducted user research, architected product wire frames, and developed prototypes for business ideas. ",
    "aboutme5": "Outside of work, I am an advocate for improving access to equitable education opportunities for minority and low-income students. As a first-generation American, I have experienced first-hand how difficult, yet essential, a proper education is to attain. And I have a passion for assisting organizations devoted to lowering the barriers for others. ",
    "aboutme6": "Thanks for taking the time for reading. I look forward to hearing from you soon!",
