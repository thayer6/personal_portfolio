    "aboutme2": "I'm also very passionate about using AI and machine learning to solve social problems. In my spare time, I volunteer as a Senior Data Scientist with the Social Impact Analytics Institute, leading a team of 12 volunteers conducting research using cutting edge NLP to identify solutions to social problems. ",
    "aboutme3": "The goal of this website is to serve as a place where I can share the projects I’m working on and link up with anyone who is willing to deep dive with me! As you can see from many of the project topics, sports are one of my passions. I’ve been an athlete all my life and was fortunate enough to play soccer and basketball in college. You won’t find a Saturday morning where I’m not watching Arsenal FC! That being said, Hotspur fans ARE welcome 🙂",
